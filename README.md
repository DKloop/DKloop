### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dev (Ironic, I know) and i'm a BSC Computer Science & Mathematics student. 

I have a background in hopsitality but, after discovering a love of all things computer, I decided to commit to a degree in what interests me most. 

I have particular interest in cyber security and would love any opportunity to learn and engage with the sector.
